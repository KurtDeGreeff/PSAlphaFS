Maximum Path Length Limitation
In the Windows API, the maximum length for a path is MAX_PATH, which is defined as 260 characters. A local path is structured in the following order: drive letter, colon, backslash, name components separated by backslashes, and a terminating null character. For example, the maximum path on drive D is "D:\some 256-character path string<NUL>" where "<NUL>" represents the invisible terminating null character for the current system codepage. (The characters < > are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of a valid path string.)

The AlphaFS library overcomes the MAX_PATH limitation of 260 characters and is provided as Open Source, licensed under the MIT license. AlphaFS provides a namespace (Alphaleonis.Win32.Filesystem) containing a number of classes. Most notable are replications of the System.IO.File, System.IO.Directory and System.IO.Path, all with support for the extended-length paths (up to 32.000 chars)

PSAlphaFS is a wrapper for the ALphaFS .NET library providing useful powerShell functions that replicate the functionality of the following cmdlets shipped by microsoft.

Get-ChildItem
Get-Item
Copy-Item
Rename-Item
Remove-Item
New-Item
Move-Item

The cmdlets in this module have been prefixed with the word "long" to distinguish them from the ones provided by microsoft.

Get-LongChildItem (alias ldir)
Get-LongItem
Copy-LongItem
Rename-LongItem
Move-LongItem
Remove-LongItem
New-LongItem
